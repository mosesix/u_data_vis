","Year title could be bigger, start HDI axis at 0.2 to increase y axis scale to be able to see change more easily, and/or make chart taller, add a trend line for all countries with data for each year to see how this moves overall, keep legend on chart constantly, look at whether having same sized data points is better than double coding, have a ghost point option which would see where points have been in previous years maybe with a line like in football goal analysis ","Overall hdi goes up over time, co2 per capita seems to peak a few years ago. ","Is there a more useful split of countries rather than by location/ region? Perhaps by GDP?","See above","Clear correlation curve between info","Not sure of the benefit of the double coding for the spot size. Lots of overlap "

"2019/10/05 4:24:32 pm GMT","Very clear and easy to read ","Change font colour indicating the year to a darker colour ","As Co2 is going down HDI is going up ","","As in answer to previous question there seems to be a correlation between rise in HDI and decrease in Co2 emissions ","See above ","No "
"2019/10/07 7:49:16 am GMT","Amazing animation. Very clever. It shows there is a clear relationship between HDI and per capita CO2 emission ","explanation of why some blobs are the same colour? different countries within the geopolitical areas?","Middle East are outliers. Data does not exist until quite recently for some countries","what is 'HDI'?","tend to be clustered by geopolitical region","Per capita consumption depends on HDI in some way","plenty!"
"2019/10/07 10:59:38 am GMT","Colourfull and animated, but can still go back and select individual years","I have not tried this myself, so I don't know what is possible, but a few suggestions are:-
Move year selector to left of chart and add 'for each year' to the title, so you can understand what is changing without guessing. Or another way maybe to show as a 'ruler' or vertical bar chart above the main graph with years on.
Move legend to below chart (or to right), or stop from disappearing and reappearing.
Later info that comes up from bottom of graph, change the order so that can see its final position on top, and not disappearing behind the others.","","","","",""
"2019/10/07 11:09:37 am GMT","The chart is visually appealing and engages you to look at the data and what is happening over time","Working with the chart is quite difficult as its very hard to see an individual country. A filter would help. Multi filters would also allow countries to be contrasted against each other. Also, could previous years be ghosted in background so the journey of emissions can be seen?","positive progress is being made in reducing emissions per capita but uncertain on what impact population growth has? what is overall picture?","It would be interesting to show relationship curves. are emerging economies following old models or are they investing in green technology?","emissions grow with development for older economies. ","good way of showing a lot of data at once. Less good for looking at detail","it took some experimentation to pause on a given year and kept messing this up. maybe a pause/play mode?"
